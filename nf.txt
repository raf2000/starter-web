Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++? (Richard A. O’Keefe) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals. (Jon Ribbens) Good code is its own best documentation. (Steve McConnell)

Never trust a computer you can’t throw out a window. (Steve Wozniak) If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) Writing in C or C++ is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards removed. (Bob Gray) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan)
